### Hi there 👋 I am
<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/MK94VyRC/nome2.png">

I'm a full stack web development student at Trybe and an electronic engineer by graduation. I am passionate about technology, programming and companies that overcome the barriers of digital innovation.
- 💬 I decided to migrate my career to IT bringing all the business analysis baggage that I acquired during more than 5 years of experience in large companies like Monsanto and Kimberly Clark.
- 🌱 I am currently finishing my master's degree in technological innovation by UNIFESP. I was certified in the data analyst bootcamp by IGTI and I have basic training in SCRUM, I also have Black belt certification and I can work with the best of agile and traditional project management. 
- ⚡ I have a multitasking profile and this allows me to work quickly with different activities, I have excellent results with teamwork, a lot of motivation, dedication and focus on results. I also have solid knowledge in statistical analysis.
- ✉ If you want to contact me I am available through the email paula.jfe@gmail.com. Thank you for your visit and see you next time.
- 🌐 Visit my [porfolio website](https://paula-jfe.github.io/) for complete background and contact.
